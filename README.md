## The Gems
Currently there's 4 gems, each with it's own use case, to give yourself a gem just use the `/givegem` command and follow the instructions! 

If a gem has an ability you must Right Click while holding it in your offhand

### Puff Gem
The Puff Gem lets you get boosted into the sky to disengage combat or just for quick movement

### Shadow Gem
When you hold the Shadow Gem in your offhand and hit something, the victim gets the darkness effect

### Strength Gem
If you use the Strength Gem's ability while the cool down is over, you get a huge damage boost

### Void Gem
If you use the Void Gem's ability while facing a wall, you will go through the wall, this requires that it's a thin wall though

### Wealth Gem
If you hold the Wealth Gem in your offhand while mining, it will increase your fortune

### Warden Gem
Use the Warden Gem's ability and you will shoot out a beam that explodes on impact with monsters, players and blocks

### Ice Gem
When you hit someone while having the Ice Gem, it will freeze them but also give you slowness

### Force Gem
When you use the Force Gem's ability it throws everyone around you into the air except you

### Dragon Gem
Use it's ability to fire a laser that creates the dragons breath effect on impact

### Magic Gem
Use it's ability to teleport 5 blocks away
