## The Gems
Currently there's 4 gems, each with it's own use case, to give yourself a gem just use the `/givegem` command and follow the instructions! 


### Puff Gem
The Puff Gem lets you get boosted into the sky to disengage combat or just for quick movement

### Shadow Gem
When you hold the Shadow Gem in your offhand and hit something, the victim gets the darkness effect

### Strength Gem
If you right click with the Strength Gem while the cool down is over, you get a huge damage boost

### Void Gem
If you right click with the Void Gem while facing a wall, you will go through the wall, this requires that it's a thin wall though

### Wealth Gem
If you hold the Wealth Gem in your offhand while mining, it will increase your fortune

### Warden Gem
Right click with the Warden Gem you will shoot out a beam that explodes on impact with monsters, players and blocks

### Ice Gem
When you hit someone while having the Ice Gem, it will freeze them but also give you slowness

### Force Gem
When you right click with the force gem it throws everyone around you into the air except you

### Dragon Gem
Right click to fire a laser that creates the dragons breath effect on impact

### Magic Gem
Right click to teleport 5 blocks away


## TODO
- Add a natural way of obtaining gems
- Give gems some sort of durability or at least make them unable to last forever
- Add more gems

## Build requirements 
- To build the plugin you must port [this](https://github.com/hmzel/ParticleSFX/tree/master) plugin to 1.20.4
- Requires Java 17+
- Intellij IDEA is strongly recommended
