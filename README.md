## The Gems
Currently there's 4 gems, each with it's own usecase, to give yourself a gem just use the `/givegem` command and follow the instructions! 
### Puff Gem
The Puff Gem lets you get boosted into the sky to disengage combat or just for quick movement
### Shadow Gem
When you hold the Shadow Gem in your offhand and hit something, the victim gets the darkness effect
### Strength Gem
If you rightclick with the Strength Gem while the cooldown is over, you get a huge damage boost
### Void Gem
If you rightclcik with the Void Gem while facing a wall, you will go through the wall, this requires that it's a thin wall though

## TODO
- Add a natural way of obtaining gems
- Give gems some sort of durability or at least make them unable to last forever
- Add more gems

## Build requirements 
- To build the plugin you must port [this](https://github.com/hmzel/ParticleSFX/tree/master) plugin to 1.20.4
- Requires Java 17+
- Intellij IDEA is strongly recommended
